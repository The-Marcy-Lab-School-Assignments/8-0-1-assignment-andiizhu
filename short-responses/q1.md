# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

What makes a middleware function different than a normal controller is that middleware is the intermediary between requests and the controller. This is because middleware does not handle the final response but performs actions on the request before use `.next()` to move the request to the next middleware or controller. In contrast, the purpose of the controller is to handle an operation to a specific path. As a result, they are usually the final response and last function as they return data back to the client.
