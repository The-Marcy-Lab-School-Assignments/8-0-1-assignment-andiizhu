# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

Static assets are unchanging files that are delivered to the client exactly how they are stored on a server. Examples of static assets are images and CSS files. In order to generate static assets in a React project, the `.jsx` files are converted to `.js` files. This allows the React files that are created to not require any additional processing when they are sent to the client. This is because React is modular and can use the same components multiple times, by removing the abstraction and having the exact code, it makes the files unchanging, and faster to process for the client.
